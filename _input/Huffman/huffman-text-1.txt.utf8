[edit] Title
The title is taken from the first line of the third stanza of the poem Non Sum 
Qualis eram Bonae Sub Regno Cynarae[2] by Ernest Dowson: "I have forgot much, 
Cynara! gone with the wind". The novel's protagonist, Scarlett O'Hara, also uses 
the title phrase in a line in the book: when her home area is overtaken by the 
Yankees, she wonders to herself if her home, a plantation called Tara, is still 
standing, or if it was "also gone with the wind which had swept through 
Georgia". More generally, the title has been interpreted as referring to the 
entire way of life of the antebellum South as having "Gone with the Wind". The 
prologue of the movie refers to the old way of life in the South as "gone with 
the windéˆ¥
